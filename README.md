# 📚 Personal Documentation

Welcome to my **Personal Documentation Repository**!

This repo contains notes, references, and guides that I’ve written while learning various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It's a way for me to consolidate what I’ve learned and to refer back to it whenever needed.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Reinforce what I learn by writing it in my own words.
- Create a personal knowledge base I can quickly refer to.
- Share resources that might help others learning the same technologies.

## 📁 Structure

Each topic has its own Markdown file in this repository. New content will be added as I continue to explore and grow as a developer.

## 📄 Available Documentations

- [HTML & CSS](./html_css.md)

*More coming soon...*

## ✅ Usage

Feel free to explore the notes! If you find something helpful or want to suggest an improvement, open an issue or submit a pull request.

🛠️ *This is a living project and will be updated regularly.*
